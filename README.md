### Project Description
Profet is an app that analyzes the ‚Äúaura,‚Äù or imagined energy field, around a user‚Äôs mobile device to offer personalized future predictions. By studying energy fluctuations in this aura, Profet delivers tailored insights on upcoming events and life choices. Through its daily and weekly forecasts, aura tracking, and predictive analysis, Profet aims to guide users toward better decision-making and self-awareness, based on unique patterns in their energy field.
### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Individuals often face uncertainty about future outcomes due to limited access to what we define as the "aura constant"‚Äîan imagined, universal energy that theoretically holds predictive insights into a person‚Äôs life path
### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Profet addresses the need for imaginative insight into the future by offering a suite of playful, aura-based features. AuraNet, a neural network uniquely trained to analyze a person‚Äôs aura through their mobile phone (seen as a primary aura indicator), provides future predictions. Profet also includes the Aura Finder, which scans images to detect positive and negative auras, and Dream Interpret, which analyzes dreams based on a user‚Äôs aura and descriptions. Additionally, Profet calculates a personal ‚ÄúAura Number,‚Äù a lucky charm inspired by individual aura readings. Together, these tools create a fun and mystical journey of self-discovery and insight
